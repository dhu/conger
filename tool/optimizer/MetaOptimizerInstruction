If the /tmp/MetaOptimizerInstruction file exist, the MetaOptimizer
will read instructions from it.

The MetaOptimizerInstruction file should only contain 1 line of 
instruction. It can be any one of the following instructions:

HA
LoadShedder
LoadManager
None

Here is the meanning of the commands:
HA: run HA only
LoadShedder: run LoadShedder and LoadManager is in passive mode
LoadManager: run LoadManager and LoadShedder is in passive mode
None: Both LoadShedder and LoadManager runs in passive mode  

If the instxpurction contains nothing or anything else or the file
does not exist, then either load manager and load shedder will run 
in active mode depending on the load level.
