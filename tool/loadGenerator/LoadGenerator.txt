This document is to describe how to run LoadGenerator with Borealis.
It includes:

*[To run Borealis and LoadGenerator]*
*[To change the rate]*
*[To save the tuples]*
*[To send the exist tuples]*
*[To run Borealis and LoadGenerator]*

1. *Aim:*
    This step is to run Borealis, deploy query network, and run LoadGenerator.

   *Action:*
    Excute "genrun" in directory "borealis/utility/test/simple".

   *Discription:*
    "genrun" is the script which use "gentest.xml" as its query network and
    "gentest_deploy.xml" as its deployment xml file. Those two files are in
    the same directory. You can change them to your relevant xml file.


2. *Aim:*
    This step is to run GUI.

   *Action:*
    Excute "ant run" in directory "borealis/utility/borealisgui".

   *Discription:*
    If you don't want to use GUI, but use your exist distribution file
    directly, you may just excute "r [distribution file name]" in the
    command line of the LoadGenerator windows(second xterm). For detail,
    refer to the displayed information in the second xterm that prompted.


3. *Aim:*
    This step is to configure distribution file and send new tuples to Borealis.

   *Action:*
    In the GUI windows, switch to the "Load Generator" tab, click the first
    "Load" button in the toolbar to load your query network file or exsit
    distribution file.  Expand the left tree. Check and configure your
    distribution file. When you are satisfied, click the first "Send"
    button in the toolbar. It will send tuples to Borealis.  To stop
    sending tuples to Borealis, click "stop" button in the toolbar.

4. *Aim:*
    This step is to save the distribution file.

   *Action:*
    When you are satisfied with the current distribution, you can click the
    first "Save" button in the toolbar to save the current distribution
    file.


*[To change the rate]*
   *Aim:*
    This step is to change the rate.

   *Action:*
    Drag the rate slider in the bottom pane. Click the "Send" button in the
    right bottom.

   *Discription:*
    The default rate is "1".

*[To save the tuples]*
   *Aim:* 
    This step is to save all the tuples that have just sent to Borealis.

   *Action:*
    Click the second "Save" button in the toolbar.
    It will save all the tuples to a binary file which you can use it later.

*[To send the exist tuples]*
   *Aim:*
    This step is to send the existing tuples to Borealis.

   *Action:*
    Click the second "Load" button in the toolbar to load your exist tuple
    files(binary files).

    Click the second "Send" button in the toolbar to send the exist tuples
    to Borealis.

   *Discription:*
    Sorry for a bug. Don't send exist tuples when you just run GUI.
    After run GUI, please send some new tuples to Borealis and stop.
    And then, you can send any exist tuple files freely.
    I am trying to fix it.
