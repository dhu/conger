Directory structure

The directory structure is as follows:
configure.ac
Makefile.am
config/          // Contains a bunch of automatically generated configuration files
src/             // Contains the main "borealis" exectuable and the main catalog: "CentralLookupServer"
apps/            // For all client apps such as the network intrusion detection app
test/		 // For everyone to put their test applications there
doc/             // Doesn't work yet but should contain the auto-generated apidoc and other documentation
modules/         // All the modules that can form a Borealis node (not all are mandatory)
modules/queryProcessor/
modules/queryProcessor/boxes
modules/queryProcessor/expr
modules/queryProcessor/plugin
modules/queryProcessor/runtime
modules/queryProcessor/store
modules/admin/
modules/ha/
modules/nhopt/
modules/lookup/
modules/rpc/        // Auto-generated RPC stubs for the modules
modules/common/     // TupleDescription.h, StreamDef.h (a mix of files from Aurora and Medusa that are used by pretty much all the modules)
modules/util/       // The util subdirectory of the original Aurora

Installation

1 If you haven't done so, check out and install nmstl

> cvs -d yourlogin@nms.lcs.mit.edu:/var/cvs co nmstl
> cd nmstl
> autoconf
> ./configure
> make
> make install

If you don't have root permission on your machine, install nmstl in your home directory:
>./configure --prefix=/some/ok/location/
Then use the "/some/ok/location" path as argument when configuring borealis (below)

2 Borealis requires a few libraries. If you don't have them on your machine, you need to install the packages listed at the beginning of this document. 

3 Now you're ready to build borealis:

> cd src
> ./setup
> wtf ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static --with-antlr=/opt/antrl/ [--with-db4=/usr/] [--with-nmstl=/usr/local/]

Explanation:
- "wtf" comes with nmstl and pretty-prints all gcc error messages (great tool!)
- There are reasonable defaults for all packages (the ones listed in the example above) so you might be able to run only:
> wtf configure --enable-shared --disable-static
- The "--enable-shared --disable-static" flags should prevent the compiler from generating static libraries.

4 Finally, you can compile and run borealis

> make
> go get a coffee
In 3 separate windows run:
> src/CentralLookupServer
> src/borealis
> test/mytest

If it's not working, email me at: borealis-support@list.cs.brown.edu
