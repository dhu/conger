The tests in this /borealis/test/valid/revisions/ directory use the
Revision*QBox.

More details about the Revision* boxes can be found at the application
programmer's guide. 

There are four tests:
  1. upstream_filter : RevisionFilter
  2. upstream_map : RevisionMap
  3. upstream_aggregate : RevisionAggregate in upstream processing mode
  4. downstream_aggregate : RevisionAggregate in downstream processing mode

validate_revisions.sh will run all the four tests one after
another. This script is called from ../validate.go.sh.
