<BR><H4>Before You Begin</H4>

<P CLASS="body">
Borealis has been built on Debian, Red Hat, Fedora Core 2, and
Mandrake GNU/Linux.  Although we are unaware of any dependencies that
may prevent it from installing and running cleanly on other varients
of GNU/Linux, we can make no such assurances.  We have performed a
partial installation on the Mac Os X Darwin release.  The versions for
some packages used in this effort are listed in case someone wants to
attempt to complete the installation for the Mac.  It can not run on a
Mac as is.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
The installation process is complex.  The software depends on external packages,
Unix environemts vary from site to site, and people have their own ways of
setting up their environments.  Consequently we can not provide rote
instructions for installing and running Borealis systems.  You will need to
read about and understand the processes related to each component and
determine how to apply them in your environment.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Read through these instructions and develop an installation plan.  Determine
which optional packages you'll want to install.  Locate and read documentation
for the external packages.  You should have a good idea how you want to lay out
the primary directories and check space requirements.  You'll also want to
determine settings for environment variables you'll be introducing for the
build process.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Primary directories are needed for your application development, the
Borealis software, the NMSTL library, Borealis utilities, and external
package binaries and their build areas.  You may want the directory
for the Borealis source tree to be your home directory or a separate
work area.  External packages, their build areas, the NMSTL library,
and Borealis utilities can be located in areas common to multiple
users or in a private work area.
</P>

<BR><H4>Installing Borealis</H4>

<P CLASS="body">
First install the external <A HREF="install.external.html">Packages
Needed For Borealis</A>.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Borealis relies heavily on the Networks, Messaging, Servers, and
Threading Library (NMSTL), a portable C++ library for writing
networking and messaging components.  We distribute the NMSTL package
along with the Borealis software.  Although <A
HREF="http://nmstl.sourceforge.net">NMSTL is publically available</A>,
the public version is unsupported and has been modified slightly for Borealis.
Only the version that is distributed with Borealis should be used.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Choose a directory where you'd like to install Borealis and NMSTL.  You may
want to put it in your home directory or a separate work area.  Unroll the
distribution tar file for Borealis and there will be two top-level directories:
<KBD>nmstl/</KBD> and <KBD>borealis/</KBD>
</P>

<BR><H4>Building Borealis</H4>
<P CLASS="body">
The Borealis software and it's subsystems can all be built with the script:
<KBD>borealis/utility/unix/build.borealis.sh</KBD>
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Carefully read the comments at the top of script and setup your environment
accordingly.  Here are some sample commands for login scripts that may help
you set up a <A HREF="login.cshrc.html">.cshrc login</A> or a
<A HREF="login.bashrc.html">.bashrc login</A> file.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
You can build Borealis only with gcc 3.3.5 and above.
There is a spurious warning was issued in gcc versions 3.3.6 through
4.0.4 that was fixed in the 4.1.1 compiler.  If you are using an
afflicted compiler you will need to use the gcc <KBD>-w</KBD> option
to suppress warnings.  Note that this means you might not see some
useful warnings, so you might want to install a newer compiler.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
You can use ccache speed up Borealis builds.  Install ccache and set the
environment variable:
</P>

<UL><PRE><B>CXX="ccache g++"; export  CXX         #sh shell
CXX="ccache g++ -w"; export  CXX      #sh shell; gcc 3.3.6 to 4.0.4
setenv  CXX  "ccache g++"             #csh shell
setenv  CXX  "ccache  g++  -w"        #csh shell; gcc 3.3.6 to 4.0.4
</B></PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
Running the build script with no arguments builds the core system and nmstl.
</P>

<UL><PRE><B>&gt; build.borealis.sh
</B></PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
When NMSTL is built it creates an installed copy in:
<KBD>${HOME}/install_nmstl/</KBD>
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Once NMSTL is built you can use the copy you just built.  You can leave it
under your home directory or copy it to a common area such as the place where
all the other packages were installed.  After that you can avoid rebuilding it
by passing the location in the <KBD>INSTALL_NMSTL</KBD> variable or with
the <KBD>-nmstl</KBD> command argument.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
At a minimum you will also want to build the client code, the Head, and
the marshaling tool.
</P>

<UL><PRE><B>&gt; build.borealis.sh  -client  -tool.marshal  -tool.head
</B></PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
In order to run the tools, directories containing the Head and marshaling
tool need to be included in your PATH variable.  You can either copy them to
a directory already on the PATH variable or add the tool directories
<KBD>borealis/tool/head/</KBD> and <KBD>borealis/tool/marshal/</KBD>
to the PATH.
</P>


<BR><H4>Testing Borealis</H4>

<P CLASS="body">
To see that Borealis runs properly, build and run the automated test suite.
It will run a few simple tests to ensure that basic operations are working.
Read the comments in the <KBD>borealis/test/valid/validate.go.sh</KBD> script
to see how to set up reference output for regression testing.
</P>

<UL><PRE><B>borealis&gt; build.borealis.sh  -test.valid
borealis&gt; test/valid/validate.go.sh  -rebase   # Establish reference output.
validate.go.sh:  Rebasing output to:  /pro/borealis/utility/valid

   ... The catalog test ran successfully.

<br><h4>Running simple applications</h4> 

<P CLASS="body">You can write your Borealis applications in either C++ or Java.

<P CLASS="body">All sample applications are located under <kbd>borealis/test/</kbd>.
You can compile all the sample applications as follows

<UL><PRE><B>
> build.borealis.sh  -test.simple       # Build tests in:  borealis/test/simple/
</B></PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
Or you can follow the usual manual instructions:

<UL><PRE><B>
> cd borealis/test/
> ./setup
> wtf configure [--with-nmstl=/my/location] [...]
> make
</B></PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
To see how to run simple C++ Borealis applications see the
examples in the <KBD>borealis/test/simple/</KBD> directory. The
examples include both single site and distributed applications.
A README file explains how to run the examples.

<P CLASS="body">

The <A HREF="viewer_guide.html">Stream Viewer</A> is a graphical user interface
included in the Borealis code base.  Please consult the &quotBorealis
Application Programmer's Guide&quot for further information about writing
Borealis applications.

</P>

<BR><BR><H4>Support Has Been Discontinued</H4>

<P CLASS="body">
Borealis is a collaborative research project developed by professors,
students, and staff at Brown, MIT, Brandeis, and the University of Washington.
The project has been retired and we are no longer able to provide support.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
Thanks for your interest in our software!
