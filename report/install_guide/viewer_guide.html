<P CLASS="body">
The Stream Viewer is used to create network topologies for Borealis
applications.  Network diagrams are constructed using &quotbox and
arrow&quot figures.  The figures are then annotated with detailed text
attributes.  The output is an XML file that may be fed into the Borealis Head;
which in turn deploys the diagram to Borealis nodes.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
The Graphical User Interface distributed in the Winter 2007 release of Borealis
has been rewritten for the Summer 2008 release and renamed the Stream Viewer.
It is in the <kbd>borealis/tool/borealis/viewer/</kbd> directory.  You will
also need to run a Global component to propagate diagrams from the Head
to the Viewer.  A basic Global component is in:
<kbd>borealis/utility/client/</kbd>
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
XML for Borealis applications can also be written using a plain text editor.
The remaining instructions are for the prior release and are only included in
lieu of new documentation.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
The tool is built using version 1.5 of the Java Developer's Kit.  Newer
versions of Java will probably work.  Try your installed version of Java
first unless you have an older version.  In that case locate a newer version
on the web that is compatible with your environment.  Note that other Java
source in the Borealis code base will build with either version 1.4 or 1.5.
</P>

<P CLASS="body">
If you need to override any older installed version, position this version
of java first on your PATH and CLASSPATH variables.
</P>

<UL><PRE>
For csh and tcsh:

    setenv  PATH       /.../java/linux/jdk1.5/bin:${PATH}
    setenv  CLASSPATH  /.../java/linux/jdk1.5/lib/jre/javaws/:${CLASSPATH}


For sh and bash:
    export  PATH=/.../java/linux/jdk1.5/bin:${PATH}
    export  CLASSPATH=/.../java/linux/jdk1.5/lib/jre/javaws/:${CLASSPATH}
</PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
The tool can then be built and run using ant.
</P>

<UL><PRE>
borealis/tool/gui>  ant         # Compile the Graphical User Interface.
borealis/tool/gui>  ant  run    # Launch the Graphical User Interface.
</PRE></UL>

<P CLASS="body">
Some of the basic operations for creating a new diagram are:
</P>

<UL CLASS="bullet">
<LI><H5>Select the Editor tab.</H5>

<LI><H5>Single click on a boxed item on the left side of the window and a
        copy with default names and values will be placed on the edit pad.</H5>

<LI><H5>On the edit pad, click and hold between items
        to connect them by a stream.</H5>

<LI><H5>Use the "Element Editor" panel to modify the default names and
        set attribute values.</H5>

<LI><H5>Define schemas using the button, "Add Schema" on the
        right hand side of the window.</H5>
